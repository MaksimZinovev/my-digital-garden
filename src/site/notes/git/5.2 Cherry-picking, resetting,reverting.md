> [!NOTE] Cherry-picking  
> Take some specific changes in a commit from one branch and apply them to another branch. That is exactly what cherry-picking allows us to do, either forcing a commit or a series of commits.

> [!NOTE] Resetting  
> We want to have back the first version of the README file.  
Exactly for that purpose, we can use resetting, to reset the HEAD pointer of our active branch, so that it points to the commit with the first version of the README file (blue).

> [!NOTE] Reset Soft
> - Command: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
> - Local repository (commits): move HEAD pointer to previous commit
> - Staging area: untouched 
> - Working directory: untouched
> - Description: reset to previous commit and leave working and staging areas untouched. We still have our changes in working directory.

> [!NOTE] Reset Mixed
> - Command: `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`
> - Local repository (commits): move HEAD pointer to previous commit
> - Staging area: replace changes in staging area with previous commit 
> - Working directory: untouched
> - Description: reset to previous commit (local repository and staging area) and leave working area untouched. We still have our changes in working directory.

> [!NOTE] Reset Hard
> - Command: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
> - Local repository (commits): move HEAD pointer to previous commit
> - Staging area: replace changes in staging area with previous commit 
> - Working directory: replace changes in working area with previous commit
> - Description: reset to previous commit (local repository, staging and working area). We still can find the commit existed before resetting using `reflog` command.
