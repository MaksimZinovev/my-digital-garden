Git has three main states, also called trees, that your files can reside in.

- Modified or newly created data is living in the **Working Tree**. This is the place where your actual files, which you can see, are on your desk.
- Stage data that you have marked a search, which then goes into your next potential commit, lives in the **Staging, or also called Index Tree**. You can also see this tree as a kind of packaging station for your files. In reality, this is nothing else but a simple binary file.
- Finally, there is the commit data, which goes into the object store, also called the **Local Repository Tree**.

Of course, there is also a connection between local repository tree and working tree. In the coming next chapters, you will see how they all interact with each other.
