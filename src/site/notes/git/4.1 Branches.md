> [!note]+ HEAD  
> HEAD is a simple file in the `.git` directory which points to the active branch and thereby to the latest commit of that branch** 

### Fast-forward Merge

> [!NOTE] Fast-forward merge  
> A fast-forward merge means that the master branch pointer HEAD can simply be moved forward to the commit where the “MyNewBranch” is pointing to. All this, because the master branch hasn't diverged through other commits on it from the “MyNewBranch”.

Example: merging 2 branches

- feature/update4-ffmerge-test (make changes)
- feature/update5-ffmerge-test (no changes)

```
git checkout -b feature/update4-ffmerge-test
```

### Update Files

git commit -am "/update5-ffmerge-test"

git checkout -b feature/update5-ffmerge-test

No Updates

Now Merge Current Branch (feature/update5-ffmerge-test) to feature/update4-ffmerge-test

git merge feature/update4-ffmerge-test

```

1. Git opens default editor
2. Provide commit message
3. Close editor
4. That's it. Now two branches ar emerged
5. Run `git log` , see additional merge commit

### Merging Diverged Branches

![Pasted image 20221230140236.png|500](/img/user/git/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221230140236.png)

Example: merging 2 branches

- feature/feature/test3-lisa-diverged (make changes)
- feature/new-test-class (make changes)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/feature/test3-lisa-diverged

# update files

git commit -am "update5-ffmerge-test"

git checkout -b  feature/new-test-class

# update files

# now merge current branch ( feature/new-test-class) to feature/feature/test3-lisa-diverged

git merge feature/test3-lisa-diverged
```

### Rebasing

![Pasted image 20221230184527.png|500](/img/user/git/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221230184527.png)

When we create a new branch, in our case here, the “MyNewBranch”, we branch away from another branch, in our case here, the master branch. The common parent commit C is the base of commit E of the “MyNewBranch”.

- By applying the concept of rebasing, we can change the base of the commit E.
- By applying the concept of rebasing, we can change this base commit C of the commit E.

Let's `checkout` the “MyNewBranch” to get with rebasing the latest changes which were made on the master branch, this is commit D, into our “MyNewBranch”.

Let's remember when we're checking out a new branch, we just move the HEAD pointer accordingly.

**When we now hit `git rebase master`, we rebase our active “MyNewBranch” onto the current state of the master branch.**

![](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/course47/chapter4.1-img28.png)  

It is important to notice here that we rebase onto the current state of the master branch and not into the master branch itself.

When rebasing, Git will take everything which was in commit E, apply that **into a commit E'**, and then puts E' on the top of the latest commit D, from the master branch.

In other words, we have just rebased the pointer “MyNewBranch” from commit E to a new commit E', which in turn is now referencing the latest commit D, of the master branch.

With using rebase, we can make sure that we frequently integrate the changes which are made on the master branch into our own feature branch. With that, we can keep a clean, linear, shiny history that allows us finally doing a fast-forward merge when it's time to get our feature or bug fix branch into the common master branch.

Keeping a clean, linear commit history makes reading it much more pleasant, useful, and finally traceable, than having a history which is cluttered with merge commits.

Example: merging 2 branches

- feature/feature/test3-lisa-rebase (make changes)
- feature/test4-lisa-rebase (make changes)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/feature/test3-lisa-rebase

# update files

git commit -am "add feature/test3-lisa-rebase"

git checkout master 

git checkout -b  feature/test4-lisa-rebase 

# update files

# now merge current branch ( feature/new-test-class) to feature/feature/test3-lisa-diverged

git merge feature/test3-lisa-diverged

git add. 

git commit -m "add feature/test4-lisa-rebase"

git checkout feature/test4-lisa-rebase 

git rebase feature/test3-lisa-rebase

git push origin 

# we need to set upstream for new branch

git push --set-upstream origin feature/test4-lisa-rebase

# now open Github
# create PR
# merge PR (rebase and merge)

git fetch 

git checkout master 
```

### Creating Pull-request

![Pasted image 20221230203456.png|500](/img/user/git/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221230203456.png)

```bash
git fetch
```

So, we fetch all the new changes which were made on the remote repository master into our local repository master.

```bash
git checkout master
```

```bash

git merge

# resolve conflicts if required
```
