## Azure VPN Gateway service

![image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/media/tutorial-site-to-site-portal/diagram.png)

Azure VPN Gateway is a service that uses a specific type of virtual network gateway to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and on-premises locations over the public Internet. You can also use VPN Gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. Multiple connections can be created to the same VPN gateway. When you create multiple connections, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth.

## What is Microsoft Sentinel?

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native solution that provides:

Security information and event management (SIEM)
Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)
Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. With Microsoft Sentinel, you get a single solution for attack detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

Microsoft Sentinel is your bird's-eye view across the enterprise alleviating the stress of increasingly sophisticated attacks, increasing volumes of alerts, and long resolution time frames

## How network security groups filter network traffic

You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

You can deploy resources from several Azure services into an Azure virtual network. For a complete list, see Services that can be deployed into a virtual network. You can associate zero, or one, network security group to each virtual network subnet and network interface in a virtual machine. The same network security group can be associated to as many subnets and network interfaces as you choose.

## Resource locks

As an administrator, you can lock an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource to protect them from accidental user deletions and modifications. The lock overrides any user permissions.

You can set locks that prevent either deletions or modifications. In the portal, these locks are called Delete and Read-only. In the command line, these locks are called CanNotDelete and ReadOnly.

CanNotDelete means authorized users can read and modify a resource, but they can't delete it.
ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update it. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions that the Reader role provides.
Unlike role-based access control (RBAC), you use management locks to apply a restriction across all users and roles. To learn about setting permissions for users and roles, see Azure RBAC.

## What is an availability set?

An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. We recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available application and to meet the 99.95% Azure SLA. There is no cost for the Availability Set itself, you only pay for each VM instance that you create.

## How do availability sets work?

- <http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines>
- <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview>

“Availability Set” refers to two or more Virtual Machines deployed across different Fault Domains to avoid a single point of failure.

Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an update domain and a fault domain by the underlying Azure platform. Each availability set can be configured with up to three fault domains and twenty update domains. These configurations can't be changed once the availability set has been created.

> Update domains indicate groups of virtual machines and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time.

When more than five virtual machines are configured within a single availability set with five update domains, the sixth virtual machine is placed into the same update domain as the first virtual machine, the seventh in the same update domain as the second virtual machine, and so on. The order of update domains being rebooted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time. A rebooted update domain is given 30 minutes to recover before maintenance is initiated on a different update domain.

> Fault domains define the group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch.

By default, the virtual machines configured within your availability set are separated across up to three fault domains. While placing your virtual machines into an availability set doesn't protect your application from operating system or application-specific failures, it does limit the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

## What is Azure Government?

US government agencies or their partners interested in cloud services that meet government security and compliance requirements, can be confident that Microsoft Azure Government provides world-class security and compliance. Azure Government delivers a dedicated cloud enabling government agencies and their partners to transform mission-critical workloads to the cloud. Azure Government services can accommodate data that is subject to various US government regulations and requirements.

## Azure Power Shell

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

## Local and Virtual Network Gateways

Local and virtual network gateways are virtual private network (VPN) gateways that are used to connect to on-premises networks and encrypt all traffic going between Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and a local network. Each virtual network can have only one virtual network gateway, but one virtual network gateway can be used to configure multiple VPN connections.

## Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide the following key benefits:

Easy to create and manage multiple VMs
Provides high availability and application resiliency by distributing VMs across availability zones or fault domains
Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes
Works at large-scale

## Azure App Service

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.

## What is Advisor?

## Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

Microsoft Cloud Adoption framework (CAF) is a proven guidance that is designed to help organizations to excel in their cloud journey. This framework guides us through various phases of journey starting from why cloud, what to move, where to move, how to move, how to manage & operate in cloud.

This framework provides a set of tools, templates, guidance, and narratives at every stage to accelerate your cloud adoption journey and it starts with

1. Strategy: which is to understand the strategy and motivations to adopt cloud.
2. Plan : Evaluating the readiness and adoption plan for planning your cloud estate.
3. Ready: Setting up the Azure landing zone and implement the best practices for future expansion.
4. Adopt: Discovering the migration/cloud native/hybrid scenarios for your workloads to act on your scenarios.
5. Govern: Assess the current and end-state with a vision and iteratively add those controls to avoid any tangible risk in future.
6. Manage: Document all operations/management baseline, design principles for landing new workloads and supporting existing workloads.

## Cloud architecture terminologies

- reliability, availability - data backup, disaster recovery and data replication, fault tolerance. [HA] Highly availablr
- scalable - increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
- elastic - automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand
- current - hardware and software is patched, upgraded and replaced by cloud provider
- fault tolerance - ability to prevent a failure
- disaster recovery - ability to recover from a failure. [DR] Highly Durable

## High availability

Ability to remain available for your services by ensuering there is no single point of failure and/or ensure a certain level of performance

Running your workload across multiple AZ ensures that if 1 or 2 AZs become unavailable your service / applications remains available.

DR - Disaster recovery

## Evolution of computing

Dedicated > VMs > Containers > Functions

## Regions and Geographies

A region is a grouping of multiple data centers

Azure operates in multiple datacenters around the world. These datacenters are grouped in to geographic regions, giving you flexibility in choosing where to build your applications.

You create Azure resources in defined geographic regions like 'West US', 'North Europe', or 'Southeast Asia'. You can review the list of regions and their locations. Within each region, multiple datacenters exist to provide for redundancy and availability. This approach gives you flexibility as you design applications to create VMs closest to your users and to meet any legal, compliance, or tax purposes.

- 58 regions
- 140 countries

## Paired regions

Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia). This approach allows for the replication of resources, such as VM storage, across a geography that should reduce the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. Additional advantages of region pairs include:

- In the event of a wider Azure outage, one region is prioritized out of every pair to help reduce the time to restore for applications.
- Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

An Azure geography is an area of the world that contains at least one Azure region. For example, India is a geography. Similarly United States and United Kingdom are geographies.

Azure Government (US)

**Azure Managed Disks**

- Locally redundant storage (LRS)
  - Replicates your data three times within the region in which you created your storage account.

**Storage account-based disks**

- Locally redundant storage (LRS)
  - Replicates your data three times within the region in which you created your storage account.
- Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
  - Replicates your data three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
  - Replicates your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
- Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
  - Replicates your data to a secondary region, as with GRS, but also then provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location.

The following table provides a quick overview of the differences between the storage replication types:

| Replication strategy | LRS | ZRS | GRS | RA-GRS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data is replicated across multiple facilities. | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Data can be read from the secondary location and from the primary location. | No | No | No | Yes |
| Number of copies of data maintained on separate nodes. | 3 | 3 | 6 | 6 |

![image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/high-availability/images/high-availability-001.png)

## AZ supported regions

Alternate or Others regions do not support availability zones.

Recommended regions are suppose to have at least 3 AZs.

## Fault and update domains

Fault domains
define the group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch.

By default, the virtual machines configured within your availability set are separated across up to three fault domains.

While placing your virtual machines into an availability set doesn't protect your application from operating system or application-specific failures, it does limit the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

![image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/media/virtual-machines-common-manage-availability/ud-fd-configuration.png)

Update Domain
ensures that Azure performs it's software updates from time to time. The resources are isolated.

Update domains indicate groups of virtual machines and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. When more than five virtual machines are configured within a single availability set with five update domains, the sixth virtual machine is placed into the same update domain as the first virtual machine, the seventh in the same update domain as the second virtual machine, and so on. The order of update domains being rebooted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time. A rebooted update domain is given 30 minutes to recover before maintenance is initiated on a different update domain.

An availability set
is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. We recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available application and to meet the 99.95% Azure SLA.
