## Chapter 1 - Explore Playwright

During installation, I faced this issue [[BUG]: Playwright VS Code extension - No tests have been found in Test Explorer · Issue #19863 · microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/19863). 

This issue did not occur when creating new folder and installing latest Playwright package. 

For cloned repo:

- Update node version - did not work 
- Installing Playwright in existing folder - worked

Can install from command pallete VS Code or 

```Shell
npm init playwright@latest
```
