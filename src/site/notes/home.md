## About

Hello! My name is Max and this is my digital garden. 

Basically, this is a collection of my markdown notes. I published them online to be able to access them any time and also share with others.

Currently, I work as a software tester based in Sydney, Australia. My professional interests include such topics as 

- testing (including exploratory, security, API, web UI testing)
- test automation
- programming 
- cloud services and technologies.

My hobbies: music, hiking, gym.
